# About

This is a playground for me to learn more about Linux drivers and the Linux kernel.

I am practicing on a Raspberry Pi 3B.

I don't technically do embedded Linux at work (we have a different POSIX compliant OS). Therefore, I'm using this as an opportunity to learn more.

I am just slowly adding things as I get time.

I will update the release notes in each directory whenever I add in a non-trivial feature.

# Custom-Drivers

The [custom-drivers](custom-drivers) directory has its own README file detailing the drivers and how to use them.

# Raspberry-Pi-Docs

The [raspberry-pi-docs](raspberry-pi-docs) directory has datasheets and specs on the Raspberry Pi 3B. It also has its own README file with miscellaneous info.
