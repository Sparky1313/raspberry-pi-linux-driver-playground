# About

This is a playground for me to learn more about Linux drivers and the Linux kernel.

I am practicing on a Raspberry Pi 3B.

I don't technically do embedded Linux at work (we have a different POSIX compliant OS). Therefore, I'm using this as an opportunity to learn more.

I am just slowly adding things as I get time.

I will update the release notes in each directory whenever I add in a non-trivial feature.
